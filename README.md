## Usage 

Generating a read me is as simple as navigating to the cloned directory in node.js, and running the index.js file with node. After that, simply reply to the command line prompts. Don't worry, you can still edit the readme after if you make a mistake. 

Below is a video demonstrating how to use the generator.
